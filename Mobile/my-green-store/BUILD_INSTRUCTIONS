How to build the app:
You will need nodejs, cordova and ionic (Xcode for iOS build and Android SDK for android)

With nodejs installed on your path, type:
$ npm install -g cordova ionic

Go to the project root and run:
$ ionic build ios
$ ionic run ios

You will need Xcode installed on your mac.
If the "run" command does not work, you can open the Xcode project generated on the platforms/ios folder.
Once the project is open on Xcode, simply choose the target and run.

You can also build the project for android. Just change "ios" to "android" and set the ANDROID_HOME ambient variable
